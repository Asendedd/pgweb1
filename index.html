        <p>Yogyakarta[a] is the capital city of the Special Region of Yogyakarta in Indonesia, in the south-central part
            of the island of Java.
            As the only Indonesian royal city still ruled by a monarchy, Yogyakarta is regarded as an important centre
            for classical Javanese fine arts and culture such as ballet,
            batik textiles, drama, literature, music, poetry, silversmithing, visual arts, and wayang puppetry.[6]
            Renowned as a centre of Indonesian education, Yogyakarta
            is home to a large student population and dozens of schools and universities, including Gadjah Mada
            University, the country's largest institute of higher education
            and one of its most prestigious.</p>
        <p>Yogyakarta is the capital of the Yogyakarta Sultanate and served as the Indonesian capital from 1946 to 1948
            during the Indonesian
            National Revolution, with Gedung Agung as the president's office. One of the districts in southeastern
            Yogyakarta, Kota, was the capital of the Mataram Sultanate
            between 1587 and 1613.</p>
